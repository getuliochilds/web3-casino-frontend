**Design Movement**: Neo-Noir Cyberpunk Luxury

**Core Principles**:
1.  **Immersive Depth**: Utilize deep, rich backgrounds with layered elements to create a sense of space and exclusivity.
2.  **High-Contrast Elegance**: Sharp contrasts between dark backgrounds and luminous accents (gold, neon) to guide attention and evoke a premium feel.
3.  **Fluid Motion**: Interactions should feel weightless and responsive, mimicking the smooth mechanics of high-end gaming equipment.

**Color Philosophy**:
-   **Dark Mode (Default)**: Deep matte black (#0A0A0A) as the canvas, accented with metallic gold (#D4AF37) for luxury and neon purple (#8B5CF6) for the Web3 tech vibe. This combination evokes a mysterious, high-stakes atmosphere.
-   **Light Mode**: Crisp platinum (#E5E5E5) backgrounds with dark charcoal (#1F1F1F) text and the same gold/purple accents. This offers a clean, modern alternative without losing the premium identity.

**Layout Paradigm**:
-   **Asymmetric Balance**: Move away from centered, static layouts. Use off-center focal points and dynamic grids to create visual interest and guide the user's eye through the content.
-   **Modular Cards**: Content is organized in sleek, glass-morphism cards that float above the background, adding depth and separation.

**Signature Elements**:
-   **Geometric Art Deco Patterns**: Subtle background patterns that nod to classic casino aesthetics but with a modern, digital twist.
-   **Glowing Borders**: Interactive elements feature subtle glows that intensify on hover, simulating the lights of a physical casino.
-   **Floating 3D Assets**: Use 3D-rendered chips, cards, and tokens as decorative elements to reinforce the gaming theme.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
-   **Micro-Haptics**: Visual feedback (scale, glow, color shift) on every interaction to simulate the tactile satisfaction of physical buttons and chips.
-   **Scroll-Triggered Reveals**: Content elements slide and fade in as the user scrolls, creating a narrative flow.

**Animation**:
-   **Entrance**: Staggered fade-up for text and elements.
-   **Hover**: Smooth scale-up and brightness increase for actionable items.
-   **Transition**: Page transitions should be seamless, utilizing cross-fades or slide-overs.

**Typography System**:
-   **Headlines**: *Montserrat* (Bold/ExtraBold) for a modern, geometric look that commands attention.
-   **Body**: *Inter* (Regular/Medium) for optimal readability and a clean, technical feel.
-   **Accents**: *Playfair Display* (Italic) for specific high-value text (e.g., "Jackpot", "VIP") to add a touch of classic elegance.

**Design Movement**: Minimalist Swiss International

**Core Principles**:
1.  **Radical Simplicity**: Strip away all non-essential elements. Focus purely on data, typography, and grid.
2.  **Grid Precision**: A strict, visible grid system that organizes content with mathematical exactness.
3.  **Objective Clarity**: Use neutral colors and clear typography to present information without emotional bias.

**Color Philosophy**:
-   **Dark Mode**: Dark grey (#121212) background with off-white (#F0F0F0) text. Accents in Swiss Red (#FF0000) for critical actions.
-   **Light Mode**: White (#FFFFFF) background with black (#000000) text. Same Swiss Red accents.

**Layout Paradigm**:
-   **Strict Grid**: Content is aligned to a rigid 12-column grid.
-   **Whitespace**: Extensive use of whitespace to separate content and create breathing room.

**Signature Elements**:
-   **Bold Typography**: Large, heavy sans-serif fonts used as the primary graphic element.
-   **Lines and Rules**: Use of horizontal and vertical lines to separate content areas.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
-   **Instant Feedback**: Interactions are immediate and snappy, with no unnecessary delays or animations.

**Animation**:
-   **Minimal**: Only essential state changes (e.g., toggle switches) are animated.

**Typography System**:
-   **Headlines**: *Helvetica Now* (Bold) for a classic, authoritative look.
-   **Body**: *Helvetica Now* (Regular) for consistency.

**Design Movement**: Retro-Futurist Synthwave

**Core Principles**:
1.  **Nostalgic Future**: Combine 80s aesthetics with modern technology.
2.  **Neon Overload**: Extensive use of glowing neon colors and grid lines.
3.  **Digital Glitch**: Incorporate glitch effects and CRT monitor aesthetics.

**Color Philosophy**:
-   **Dark Mode**: Deep purple (#2D004E) background with neon pink (#FF00FF) and cyan (#00FFFF) accents.
-   **Light Mode**: Not applicable (Synthwave is inherently dark).

**Layout Paradigm**:
-   **Perspective Grids**: Use of perspective grids to create depth and a sense of movement.

**Signature Elements**:
-   **Sunsets and Palms**: Classic Synthwave imagery.
-   **Wireframe Graphics**: 3D wireframe models of casino elements.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
-   **Gamified**: Interactions should feel like playing an arcade game.

**Animation**:
-   **Glitch and Scanlines**: CRT-style effects on hover and transition.

**Typography System**:
-   **Headlines**: *Outrun* (Custom) for a stylized look.
-   **Body**: *Roboto Mono* for a retro-tech feel.
